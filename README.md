# XarigamiND Sniffer Module

The Sniffer module was used by two modules not present in this repository,
so this is not much of use: Netquery and Statistics.

The purpose of this module is to collect visitor browser information in
the database. It is based on a very old browser detection class that 
would require new browsers and operating systems to be added. 

But since the code is pretty robust and really does what it is supposed
to do, I keep it for now. It's easy to add some more browsers if needed.
